# Simple File Browser v0.1

**Still in the very early stages of development**

This file browser intends to be used as a viewer for uploaded files.
To Upload files and screen shots, I'm using [Monosnap's](http://monosnap.com/) FTP feature to move files to my "files" directory.

### Features
- Displays all files in "files" directory
- Auto Generates thumbnails for images
- Auto Generates thumbnails for fonts
- Directory Navigation with AJAX

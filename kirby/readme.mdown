# Kirby Toolkit

Welcome to Kirby â€“ a stripped down and easy to use toolkit for PHP. It's by no means a full featured mvc/wtf framework, it's more like jQuery or Mootools for PHP. Kirby is there to make nerdy things a little less nerdy.

Kirby is completely free to use as long as you put a link to my page in your code somewhere. Please read the [docs][] to learn more about it, [follow Kirby on Twitter][twitter] and [download][download] the latest version to get started.

## Features

- Database Handling (MySQL)
- Loads of string and array helpers
- File and directory handling
- Session and Cookie helpers

- Easy language support
- Easy request handling
- Validation

Here are two tiny examples to give you a better idea what Kirby does

## Easy database handling

    <?php
      
    require_once('kirby.php');
      
    // setup the database
    c::set('db.host', 'localhost');
    c::set('db.user', 'root');
    c::set('db.password', 'password');
    c::set('db.name', 'database');
      
    // select all users from an imaginary user table
    $users = db::select('users', '*');
      
    // build a list of encoded email addresses
    // with a fallback for users without an email address
    foreach($users AS $user) {
        echo str::email( a::get($user, 'email', 'no email') );
    } 
      
    ?>

## Handling requests and validation

    <?php

    require_once('kirby.php');

    if(get('submit')) {
    
        $email = get('email');

        if(!v::email($email)) {
            echo 'That is not a valid email address';
        } else {
            db::insert('newsletter', array('email' => $email));
            go('/success');
        }
    
    }

    ?>
    <form>
      <input type="text" name="email" />
      <input type="submit" name="submit" value="Subscribe" />
    </form>

## Requirements
Kirby likes PHP 5, Apache on unix systems and MySQL. Everything else is not supported.
